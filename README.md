# An Introduction To ASP.NET Core MVC
In these articles, through a project called BooksStore, I want to show you a realistic development process from inception to deployment. I used Windows 10, Visual Studio 2019 and SQL Server LocalDB.
In my application, called BooksStore, I will create an online book catalog that customers can browse by genre and page, a shopping cart where users can add and remove books, and a checkout where customers can enter their shipping details. I will also create an administration area that includes create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) facilities for managing the catalog, and I will protect it so that only logged-in administrators can make changes.
